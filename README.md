Independent Capstone Project for CSCI 370: Mobile Application Development

This repository contains a mobile app that allows users to order a cake from a bakery. The app opens up to a Home page that contains a description about the bakery and a button that takes the user to an order screen. There the user can go through a 4 page order screen containing personal information, order information, payment details, and a review page. The user can then navigate to a page containing all of the orders they have placed. The app also contians an image gallery with descriptions on each previous cake and pop up modals.
